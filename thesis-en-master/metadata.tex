% Abstract (recommended length around 80-200 words; this is not a copy of your thesis assignment!)
\def\Abstract{%
\xxx{Use the most precise, shortest sentences that state what problem the
thesis addresses, how it is approached, pinpoint the exact result achieved, and
describe the applications and significance of the results. Highlight anything
novel that was discovered or improved by the thesis. Maximum length is 200
words, but try to fit into 120. Abstracts are often used for deciding if
a reviewer will be suitable for the thesis; a well-written abstract thus
increases the probability of getting a reviewer who will like the thesis.}
